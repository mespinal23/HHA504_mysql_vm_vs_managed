After working on both parts of this assignment, I realized that choosing between a MySQL database on a VM and a managed MySQL service really depends on the project and how much time you want to spend maintaining it.

For a small student app, I would choose the managed MySQL service. It is much easier to set up, and most of the hard work-like updates, backups, and security patches is already taken care of by the cloud provider. As someone still learning, I found the managed service much quicker to get working, and it required fewer steps. A small student app usually doesn’t need anything complicated, so a managed database makes everything smoother.

For a departmental analytics database, I would still choose the managed service, especially as someone new to this. Departments usually need something reliable that can run smoothly without a lot of technical maintenance. The managed database already comes with built-in backups, monitoring, and performance tools. If I tried to run this on a VM, I feel like I could easily mess something up or forget an important security setting. The managed service just feels safer and easier for someone still learning.

For a HIPAA aligned workload, I would definitely choose the managed database, again from a beginner’s point of view. HIPAA requires a lot of security rules, and keeping up with them on a VM seems overwhelming. With the managed service, many of the important protections like encryption and automatic updates are already handled for you. As someone new to cloud security, I would trust the managed service much more because it reduces the chance of mistakes when dealing with sensitive healthcare data.

Overall, the managed service feels more beginner-friendly and reliable.
